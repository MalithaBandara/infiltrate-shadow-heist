# Project: Infiltrate: Shadow Heist

A 2D side-scrolling stealth game, visually similar to Shadow Fight / Vector,
with a heist/infiltration objective similar to Robbery Bob.

**Target platforms: Android and iOS. Both are required — this is a
cross-platform Kotlin Multiplatform hackathon submission (Shipaton 2026),
and the app must work on both platforms.**

## Tech stack
- Engine: KorGE (Kotlin Multiplatform game engine)
- NOT using Compose Multiplatform — no Compose dependencies anywhere in this project
- Targets: Android, iOS, JVM desktop (JVM used for local dev/testing only —
  Android and iOS are the actual shipping targets)
- Payments: RevenueCat via `purchases-kmp-core` only (plain Kotlin SDK).
  Do NOT add `purchases-kmp-ui` — it requires Compose. The paywall is
  hand-built in KorGE UI instead.

## Secrets and credentials — CRITICAL

Before ANY git commit or push, scan changed files for:
- API keys (RevenueCat, Google Play, App Store Connect, etc.)
- Passwords or auth tokens
- Signing certificates, provisioning profiles, keystore files
- Any string that looks like a key (long random alphanumeric sequences
  near words like "key", "secret", "token", "password", "credential")

If anything matches:
1. STOP. Do not commit.
2. Warn the user explicitly, showing the file and line in question.
3. Suggest moving the value to GitHub Actions secrets (Settings →
   Secrets and variables → Actions) or a local .env / .gitignore'd file
   instead.
4. Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

This repo is PUBLIC. Anything committed is visible to everyone and stays
in git history even if later deleted, unless history is rewritten.
Never assume a placeholder or "TODO: add real key later" is safe to
commit if it resembles a real key format — flag it anyway.
